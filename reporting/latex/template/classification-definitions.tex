\subsection*{Risk Classifications}

\begin{table}[htp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{5.35in}|}
\hline
\rowcolor[HTML]{C0C0C0} 
\textbf{Level} &
  \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\cellcolor[HTML]{C0C0C0}\textbf{Description}} \\ \hline
\cellcolor[HTML]{\critColor}Critical &
  The vulnerability poses an immediate threat to the organization. Successful exploitation may permanently affect the organization. Remediation should be immediately performed. \\ \hline
\cellcolor[HTML]{\highColor}High &
  The vulnerability poses an urgent threat to the organization, and remediation should be prioritized. \\ \hline
\cellcolor[HTML]{\medColor}Medium &
  Successful exploitation is possible and may result in notable disruption of business functionality. This vulnerability should be remediated when feasible. \\ \hline
\cellcolor[HTML]{\lowColor}Low &
  The vulnerability poses a negligible/minimal threat to the organization. The presence of this vulnerability should be noted and remediated if possible. \\ \hline
\cellcolor[HTML]{\infoColor}Informational &
  These findings have no clear threat to the organization but may cause business processes to function differently than desired or reveal sensitive information about the company. \\ \hline

\subsection*{Sophistication Classifications}

\begin{table}[htp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{5.77in}|}
\hline
\rowcolor[HTML]{C0C0C0} 
\textbf{Level} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\cellcolor[HTML]{C0C0C0}\textbf{Description}} \\ \hline
\cellcolor[HTML]{\highColor}High &
  Exploitation requires a deep understanding of the underlying systems or advanced technical skills. Precise conditions may be required for successful exploitation. \\ \hline
\cellcolor[HTML]{\medColor}Medium &
  Exploitation methods are well-known and may be performed using public tools but require configuration. An understanding of the underlying system is required for successful exploitation. \\ \hline
\cellcolor[HTML]{\lowColor}Low &
  Exploitation methods are well-known and can be performed using publicly available tools. Low-skilled attackers and automated tools could successfully exploit the vulnerability with minimal difficulty. \\ \hline

\subsection*{Remediation Classifications}

\begin{table}[htp]

\cellcolor[HTML]{\highColor}High &
  Remediation may require extensive reconfiguration of underlying systems that is time consuming. Remediation may require disruption of normal business functions. \\ \hline
\cellcolor[HTML]{\medColor}Medium & Remediation may require minor re-configurations or additions that may be time-intensive or expensive. \\ \hline
\cellcolor[HTML]{\lowColor}Low    & Remediation can be accomplished in a short amount of time, with little difficulty.                   \\ \hline
