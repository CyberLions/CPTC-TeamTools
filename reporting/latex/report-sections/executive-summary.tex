\section{Executive Summary}

\begin{fullwidth}
% This part is canned language that doesn't need to change other than the nums

\teamName\ performed a security assessment of the internal corporate network of \clientFullName\ on \reportDate. \teamName’s penetration test simulated an attack from an internal threat actor attempting to access systems within the \clientFullName\ corporate network. This assessment aimed to discover and identify vulnerabilities in \clientFullName’s infrastructure and suggest methods to remediate the vulnerabilities. \teamName\ identified a total of 999 vulnerabilities within the scope of the engagement broken down as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 5 \textbf{Critical} vulnerabilities
    \item 3 \textbf{High} vulnerabilities
    \item 7 \textbf{Medium} vulnerabilities
    \item 3 \textbf{Low} vulnerabilities
\end{itemize}

The highest severity vulnerabilities allow potential attackers to \textbf{<BAD ACTIONS THAT COULD OCCUR HERE - FULL PARAGRAPH WITH HIGH-LEVEL DETAIL>}. To ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, security remediations should be implemented as described in the security assessment findings. 

Note that this assessment may not disclose all vulnerabilities in the systems within the scope. Any changes made to the environment during the testing period may affect the assessment results.
